  # Darwin - Skill Evolution System

  Darwin monitors, evaluates, and evolves your Claude Code skills over time.

  ## Commands

  **Usage:** `/darwin [command]`

  | Command | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | `status` | Dashboard with fitness scores for all skills (default) |
  | `evaluate [skill]` | Deep analysis of a specific skill |
  | `evolve` | Run evolution cycle (suggest + apply mutations) |
  | `suggest` | Show mutation suggestions without applying |
  | `telemetry` | View raw recent telemetry events |
  | `compile [skill]` | Recompile skill from modules |

  ## Evolution Commands

  ### Command: `evolve`
  Run the evolution engine to improve underperforming skills.
  ```bash
  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/evolve.py cycle
  ```

  ### Command: `suggest`
  Show what mutations would be applied without changing anything.
  ```bash
  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/evolve.py suggest
  ```

  ### Command: `compile [skill]`
  Recompile a skill from its module definition.
  ```bash
  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/compile.py [skill]
  ```

  ## No Data Handling

  If telemetry files are empty or missing, explain how to start collecting data:
  1. Start a NEW Claude session (hooks don't apply to current session)
  2. Use some skills: /plan, /commit, /techdebt
  3. Run /darwin status again
